## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Is there some state we need to initialize?
6) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
7) Think about how to validate each of your steps


Data Modeling Plan (product idea):

Main Goal. Just create a Products page. 

1. Create a Product Line:
    - Music Albums (based on genre)
    - pop, hiphop, rock, country, indie, 
    - each album (genre) needs unique ID
    - ie (id= pop, id = hiphop, id = rock, etc.)

2. needs user-friendly name of product (5ea):
    - pop, rap, rock, country, indie

3. needs images of each album genre (5ea):
    - google
    - put it in assets folder
    - copy and paste the relative path once in asset folder

4. needs description of product (albumb genre) (5ea):
    - just describe the vibes of each album in index.html

5. needs category of each product (5ea):
    - pop, rap, rock, country, indie

6. needs price for each product (5ea):

7. Needs button for each product (5ea):
    -button ID
